## ✨ What is VibeMuse?

VibeMuse turns emotions into experiences.

You describe your current mood (text or voice), and VibeMuse instantly generates:
- a mood classification  
- a custom color palette  
- an animated visual or image  
- a short music loop  
- a poetic AI persona that chats in the same vibe  

Each generated vibe can be saved, shared, and explored in a public gallery.

5. Users can save and share their vibe
